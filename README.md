# CS542 Common Task
Dylan Tamayo

In this project, I created a pipeline for collecting weather data from multiple sources using API calls, Python modules, and web scraping; tested different machine learning models to forecast weather temperature; and automated API trading on the Kalshi market based on predicted values.
